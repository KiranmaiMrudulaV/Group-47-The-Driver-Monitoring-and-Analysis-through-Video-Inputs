# The Driver Monitoring and Analysis through Video Inputs
Group 47
Learn about a contextually aware technology that uses facial recognition to continuously assess a driver's attentiveness and mood, improving road safety. In order to prevent accidents, the system modifies its responses in real-time in response to variables including weather, traffic, and road conditions. It does this by initiating the proper interventions, such as auto-parking mode and reminders.
